## Who are we?
We are a small group of a students organization serving as the warehouse for code for modules that are offered at NUST, and as well as a platform for the budding coders to get familiar with Git and Github.

#### Disclosure
We are not run by NUST or have any affliations with the administration, we are just here to help and guide our fellow students on the yellow brick path of their coding journey.
