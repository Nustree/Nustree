EXPLAIN QUICK SORT AND MERGE SORT ALGORITHMS

Quick sort 
employs the divide and conquer by dividing the list of elements into two sub elements.
this algorithm is quite efficient for large sized data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of O(nlogn) where n is the number of items.
The process is as follows
Select an element, pivot, from the list.
Rearrange the elements in the list, so that all elements those are less than the pivot are arranged before the pivot 
and all elements which are greater than the pivot are arranged  after the pivot. Now the pivot is in its position.
Sort the both sub lists of the elements which are less than pivot and the lists elements which are more than the pivot recursively.
 
  QUICK SORT PIVOT ALGORITHM
  STEP 1. START
  STEP 2. CHOOSE THE HIGHEST INDEX VALUE AS PIVOT
  STEP 3. TAKE 2 VARIABLES TO POINT LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE LIST EXCLUDING THE PIVOT
  STEP 4. LEFT POINT TO THE LOW INDEX
  STEP 5. RIGHT POINTS TO THE HIGH
  STEP 6. WHILE VALUE AT THE LEFT IS LESS THAN PIVOT MOVE RIGHT
  STEP 7. WHILE VALUE AT RIGHT IS GREATER THAN PIVOT MOVE LEFT
  STEP 8. IF BOTH STEP 5 AND 6 DOES NOT MATCH SWAP LEFT AND RIGHT
  STEP 9. IF LEFT >= RIGHT, THE POINT WHERE THEY MEET IS THE NEW PIVOT.
  STEP 10. STOP
  
Merge sort
is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique.
with worst case time complexity being O(nlogn), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

Algorithm
merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more be divided
it combines smaller sorted lists keeping the new list in sorted order.

step 1. Start
step 2. if it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return
step 3. divide the list recursively into two halves until it can nomore be divided
step 4. merge the smaller lists into new list in a sorted manner.
step 5. stop.
