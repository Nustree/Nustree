### Uploading exam papers (how-to guide)
1. Upload the desired exam papers to your Google Drive account, preferably your NUST Gmail and the exam papers in pdf format.
2. Once the papers are uploaded create a shareable link for those papers with ```Anyone with a link``` and ```View only``` options enabled.
3. In your forked repository update the ```README.md``` file of your course with a [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).
4. Anyone who wants the papers will just view them using your links and has the option to download them too.
5. Happy Preparations!!
